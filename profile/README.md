# SurveyAI

Welcome to the **SurveyAI** project! This organization is dedicated to developing an intelligent bot designed to automate the process of completing surveys.

## Overview

SurveyAI leverages advanced AI techniques to interact with and complete surveys. Our goal is to streamline survey participation, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in responses. The bot uses a combination of web scraping, machine learning models, and automation tools to achieve this.

## Features

- **Automated Survey Navigation**: Seamlessly navigates through survey pages.
- **Question and Answer Processing**: Utilizes AI models to understand and respond to survey questions.
- **Annotation Integration**: Annotorious integration for live annotation and interaction.
- **Survey Type Configuration**: Supports specific configurations for different survey types, including Qualtrics.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Interacts with survey elements in real-time using Selenium and xdotool.

## Usage

1. **Configure the bot:**
    Adjust the settings in `config.json` to match your survey requirements.

2. **Run the bot:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
